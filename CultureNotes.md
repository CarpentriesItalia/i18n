# Culture Notes for Japanese lessons

- non-literal translation are ok (for example characters Japanese people may not know)

- please document them here to ensure that we are consistent throughout lessons

- if you have a suggestion please discuss it as an issue on GitHub 

- Gregorian calendar dates follow the order year, month, day. Following typical
  Japanese usage, use ``yyyy.mm.dd`` over the ISO standard using ``yyyy-mm-dd``.

- Avoid dates using the Japanese era name (年号, nengou), e.g. 2018 is "Heisei 30".

## git-novice

- the characters "Wolfman" and "Dracula" may not be well-known in Japan
    - the characters ドラえもん(Doraemon) and のび太(Nobita) will be used instead
    - these are widely known and in tone with the fun nature of the English characters

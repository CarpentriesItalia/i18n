- Demonstration of git-novice lesson initialised
    - assets for Japanese developed
    - some example translations have been done

    - all translations so far will need to be double-checked
    - extra care will be needed for the `lang.md` assets since
      these will be used across different lessons

### to do

- import translation files for other lessons

- decide who will be working on each lesson (or subsection)

- discuss peer-review or culture changes on GitHub
    - non-literal translation are ok (for example characters Japanese people may not know)
